it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,
as we have now realized that anyone could die at anytime,
and it was foolish of us to waste our lives away, waste love away,
and the bonds we have, all wasted over the tiniest of matters
whereas we should cherish those things because those people 
the people we take for granted will someday be the very same people that will mourn you
or the very same people you could end up burying, with many things left unsaid
many things left undone 
...all gone
